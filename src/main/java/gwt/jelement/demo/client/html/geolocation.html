        <h3>Geolocation demo</h3>
        <p>Everyone it seems has to have a Google Map demo. If everything went well, you should be seeing your
            location on the map to the left, obtained with your consent through the Geolocation API.</p>
        <p>The code to display the map was taken fron the Google Maps JavaScript API guide
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map"
               target="_blank">Adding a Google Map with a Marker to Your Website</a>. Of note in the code
            below is the implementation of the callback, whose name is specified in the URL used to load the script,
            a common pattern for many Google JavaScript APIs.</p>
        <p>Note that use of <code>JsObject</code> as property maps is for demonstration purposes only,
            a production app would have POJOs exported via jsnterop to define the various property maps.
