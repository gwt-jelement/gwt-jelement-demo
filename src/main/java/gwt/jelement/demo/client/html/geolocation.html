        <h3>Geolocation demo</h3>
        <p>Everyone it seems has to have a Google Map demo. If everything went well, you should be seeing your
            location on the map to the left, obtained with your consent through the Geolocation API.</p>
        <p>The code to display the map was taken fron the Google Maps JavaScript API guide
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map"
               target="_blank">Adding a Google Map with a Marker to Your Website</a>. Of note in the code
        below is the implementation of the callback, whose name is specified in the URL used to load the script.
            This is the case as well as many other Google APIs, and requires that a function with the same name
            as the callback specified in the URL be registered in the global <code>window</code> object.</p>
        <p>The <code>Map</code>and <code>Marker</code> classes are created through jsinterop, see the
            <a href="https://github.com/gwt-jelement/gwt-jelement-demo" target="_blank">GitHub project</a> for details.
            Also note that use of <code>JsObject</code> as property maps is for demonstration purposes only,
            a production app would have POJOs exported via jsnterop to define the various property maps.
