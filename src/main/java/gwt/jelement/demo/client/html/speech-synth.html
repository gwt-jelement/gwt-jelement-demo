<h3>Speech Synthesis Demo</h3>

    <p>
        This demo should work on the <a href="http://caniuse.com/speech-synthesis/embed/" target="_blank">
        latest version of modern browsers</a>, although with different capabilities. Be sure to try out
        the demo on Chrome and another browser like Edge or Firefox.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that there is a bug in the Chrome implementation of <code>SpeechSynthesis::cancel</code> which makes it
        nearly useless
        in clearing queued utterances. A better implementation would queue one untterance at a time, and use the
        <code>onend</code> event of the <code>SpeechSynthesisUtterance</code> to queue the next one. As it is with
        the current code, if you stop and start the demo by exiting before it is done, you will get utterances
        interleaved with each other. The only cure is to restart the browser, reload will not have any effect.
